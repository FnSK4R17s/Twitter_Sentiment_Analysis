## What is Bitcoin?
Bitcoin is a Decentralised Cryptocurrency !

It is an open source software which is use to make digital payments without the involvement of a centralized agency or a Bank.

## How does it function ?
It runs on a Blockchain. Blockchain is a distributed ledger which is installed in every node in the bitcoin network.
Each node in the bitcoin network is called a Miner. Miners are responsible for maintaining the bitcoin network by approving transactions made via the bitcoin network.

### Blockchain
Blockchain is a data structure of blocks where each block is connected to the next block just like a chain.

## Why is it important ?
Bitcoin is important because it is decentralized, and immutable i.e. no one can undo whatever is written on the blockchain.
To push a transaction to the bitcoin network each and every miner has to approve the transaction as a genuine one by showing a proof of work. If more than 50% of the miners approve of the transaction, it is added to the bitcoin network or the blockchain.
It is so safe because the total number of miners is very big and no one owns so much computing power (50%) that they can fake a transaction in the network.

(50% of networks computing power is morer than the sum of computing power of to 500 Supercomputers combined !)

These keys will help the API for authentication.

6. For access token, click ” Create my access token”. The page will refresh and generate access token.

Tweepy is one of the library that should be installed using pip. Now in order to authorize our app to access Twitter on our behalf, we need to use the OAuth Interface. Tweepy provides the convenient Cursor interface to iterate through different types of objects. Twitter allows a maximum of 3200 tweets for extraction.

These all are the prerequisite that have to be used before getting tweets of a user.
